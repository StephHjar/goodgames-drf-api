# GoodGames
Welcome to the DRF API for GoodGames! 

GoodGames is a website where you can share the video games you're currently playing, and leave a review for each game. You can like other users' posts, reviews, and games, and leave comments on other users' "Currently Playing" posts. 

This is the backend API database, built with Django REST Framework. The deployed version of the API is HERE, and the deployed version of the full site built in React is HERE.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
In the planning stage of this project, I created this Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to better visualize the relationships between models in the database.

## User Stories
I have divided the functionality of the site and database into epics and user stories:

### **Epic:** Account Management

**User Stories:**

- As a **user** I can **add a profile photo and description** so that **I can personalise my profile**
- As a **user** I can **request to reset my password via email** so that **I can log back in to my account if I forget my login details**
- As a **user** I can **delete my profile** so that **my personal details are not saved if I don't want to use the site anymore**

### **Epic:** Managing Posts

**User Stories:**
- As a **user** I can **add a new post** so that **I can show when I start playing a game** 
- As a **user** I can **edit my posts** so that **I can make updates, or mark when I have finished playing the game**
- As a **user** I can **delete my posts** so that **I can remove posts made in error, or that I don't want displayed on my profile anymore**

### **Epic:** Admin Capabilities

**User Stories:**

## Testing 

### Manual Testing

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 


## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
